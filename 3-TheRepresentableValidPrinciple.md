## Applying the Linus Torvalds "Good Taste" coding requirement

Limit the number of states and state transitions to the minimum number necessary.
(The linked medium article looks like it's being monetized. Medium says I have only 2 free stories left. Some students may find it hard to access it.)

## Bugs and Battleships

For fizzbuzz this would be multiples of only 3, multiples of only 5, multiples of both 3 and 5, multiples of neither. Changes to the spec that increase the state space may split test cases. We could add another case to fizzbuzz (e.g. multiples of 45) that would split the "multiples of both 3 and 5" case into "multiples of 3 and 5 but not 45" and "multiples of 45".

## The Most Dangerous Code in the World

They would need to slowly release updates to their library over time with backwards compatible breaking changes to get users to eventually migrate to a simpler version. Which would likely never happen. They could also release a new version of their library wrapping confusing API such as this will a simpler strictly secure one. With good documentation this would also help demonstrate to others how to properly use the more advanced flags. (Another benefit would be to dogfood their library...)
